    <p class="pl-4">
      The PSciBIS is an enterprise grade web application where government
      contractors generate and use actionable insight to help them produce more
      effective bid packages.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-6 mb-4 text-gray-500 italic">
      Here are the main elements within the PSciBIS:
    </h4>

    <p class="mt-3 font-bold">Resources:</p>

    <p class="pl-4">
      The resources section provides a centralized and secure company-wide
      shared repository of all your key procurement related files. This section
      provides for rapid search and access to all your procurement resources
      from a single location. Tags can be added to resources for grouping and
      quick filtering purposes. When new resources are added, they can either be
      uploaded directly into the system for secure storage or hyperlinked to the
      repository that they currently reside in.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3 font-bold">Projects:</p>

    <p class="pl-4">
      The projects section allows for the creation of collaborative workspaces
      that allows assigned team members to communicate amongst each other and
      share information such as notes, resources and generated assets.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3 font-bold">Insight generator:</p>

    <p class="pl-4">
      Insight generators are intelligence-powered tools designed to provide
      actionable insights to assist in the procurement process. The various
      insight generators are designed to add efficiency and intelligence into
      the existing workflows and roles of team members to supplement their daily
      activities. The outputs created by the insight generators are known as
      insight assets. Some generators are designed to accept only a single input
      while others are conversational and allow for follow-up inputs to create a
      more tailored and powerful generated asset.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3 font-bold">Insight asset:</p>

    <p class="pl-4">
      An insight asset is the output that is created by an insight generator.
      Assets can be saved and attached to projects for shared use across the
      team.
